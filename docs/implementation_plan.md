# Implementation Plan - Facial Recognition Service

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Project Setup
   - [  ] Initialize FastAPI project with project structure
   - [  ] Set up Docker configuration
   - [  ] Configure PostgreSQL with vector extension
   - [  ] Set up alembic migrations
   - [  ] Configure logging and basic monitoring

2. Base Implementation
   - [  ] Implement core exceptions and custom error handling
   - [  ] Set up dependency injection container
   - [  ] Create basic health check endpoint
   - [  ] Implement configuration management

## Phase 2: Recognition Pipeline (Week 2)
1. Face Recognition Implementation
   - [  ] Integrate InsightFace model
   - [  ] Implement FaceRecognizer interface
   - [  ] Add face detection and embedding extraction
   - [  ] Add face comparison functionality
   - [  ] Add basic caching for model loading
   - [  ] Implement temporary image processing pipeline
   - [  ] Add cleanup for processed images

2. Storage Implementation
   - [  ] Create database schema for faces and albums (independent from marketplace DB)
   - [  ] Implement PostgreSQL vector storage for face embeddings
   - [  ] Add indexing for face embeddings
   - [  ] Implement basic query optimization
   - [  ] Add external image reference handling (marketplace image IDs/URLs)
   - [  ] Ensure no direct dependencies on marketplace database

## Phase 3: API Development (Week 2-3)
1. Core Endpoints (AWS Rekognition Compatible)
   - [  ] IndexFaces
   - [  ] SearchFacesByImage
   - [  ] CompareFaces
   - [  ] DeleteFaces

2. Request/Response Handling
   - [  ] Implement input validation
   - [  ] Add response models
   - [  ] Add error responses
   - [  ] Implement rate limiting

## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (Week 3)
1. Testing
   - [  ] Unit tests for core components
   - [  ] Integration tests for API endpoints
   - [  ] Performance tests with sample datasets
   - [  ] Load testing for concurrent requests

2. Documentation
   - [  ] API documentation with examples
   - [  ] Deployment guide
   - [  ] Configuration guide
   - [  ] Monitoring setup guide

## Phase 5: Production Readiness (Week 4)
1. Performance Optimization
   - [  ] Implement connection pooling
   - [  ] Add caching layer
   - [  ] Optimize query performance
   - [  ] Add batch processing capabilities

2. Monitoring & Operations
   - [  ] Add Prometheus metrics
   - [  ] Set up basic alerting
   - [  ] Add request tracing
   - [  ] Implement graceful shutdown

3. Security
   - [  ] Add authentication
   - [  ] Implement rate limiting
   - [  ] Add input sanitization
   - [  ] Security headers

## Key Metrics for Production Readiness
- Response time: < 500ms for face search
- Concurrent requests: Handle 50+ simultaneous requests
- Accuracy: > 95% match rate for same person
- Error rate: < 0.1% system errors
- Storage efficiency: < 1KB per face embedding
- Zero image storage footprint (process-only)

## Dependencies
- FastAPI + Uvicorn
- InsightFace
- PostgreSQL with pgvector
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- Prometheus client
- Python 3.9+
- Docker

## Notes
- Start with single-instance deployment
- Focus on API compatibility with AWS Rekognition
- Prioritize reliability over advanced features
- Keep monitoring simple but effective
- No persistent image storage - process and discard
- Maintain strict database independence from marketplace
