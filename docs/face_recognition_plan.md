# Face Recognition Implementation Plan

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Face Recognition Model**
   - Options:
     - InsightFace (current best performance/accuracy trade-off)
     - DeepFace (easier to use but slower)
     - Custom ONNX models
   - Considerations:
     - Performance vs accuracy
     - Ease of deployment
     - Memory footprint
     - License compatibility

2. **Image Processing Pipeline**
   - Input formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
   - Image size limits
   - Pre-processing steps
   - Memory management
   - Cleanup strategy

3. **API Design**
   - AWS Rekognition compatibility:
     - IndexFaces
     - SearchFacesByImage
     - CompareFaces
   - Request/Response formats
   - Error handling
   - Validation rules

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Face Recognition (Week 1)
1. Set up face recognition model
   - [ ] Model initialization and caching
   - [ ] Memory optimization
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Performance monitoring

2. Basic operations
   - [ ] Face detection
   - [ ] Embedding extraction
   - [ ] Face comparison
   - [ ] Quality checks

### Phase 2: API Implementation (Week 1-2)
1. Image handling
   - [ ] Input validation
   - [ ] Pre-processing pipeline
   - [ ] Memory-efficient processing
   - [ ] Cleanup routines

2. Endpoints
   - [ ] IndexFaces
   - [ ] SearchFacesByImage
   - [ ] CompareFaces

### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization (Week 2)
1. Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Memory profiling

2. Optimization
   - [ ] Batch processing
   - [ ] Caching strategies
   - [ ] Resource management

## Performance Targets

- Response times:
  - Face detection: < 100ms
  - Face comparison: < 50ms
  - Search operation: < 200ms
- Memory usage:
  - Model loading: < 2GB
  - Per request: < 200MB
- Accuracy:
  - Face detection: > 95%
  - Face matching: > 90% @ 0.1% FAR

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Stateless Design**
   - No shared state between instances
   - Model caching per instance
   - Clean temporary files

2. **Resource Management**
   - Memory limits per request
   - Automatic cleanup
   - Request timeouts

3. **Monitoring**
   - Response times
   - Memory usage
   - Model performance
   - Error rates

## Next Steps

1. Choose face recognition model based on:
   - Benchmark results
   - License compatibility
   - Deployment requirements

2. Create proof of concept for:
   - Model loading and caching
   - Basic face operations
   - Memory management

3. Design API endpoints with:
   - Clear validation rules
   - Error handling
   - Performance monitoring
