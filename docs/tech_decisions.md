# Face Recognition Implementation: InsightFace + ONNX

## Why InsightFace?
- Production-ready with 99.77% accuracy on LFW benchmark
- Cost-effective: fixed infrastructure cost vs pay-per-request APIs
- Self-hosted: better privacy and control
- ONNX runtime: hardware-optimized performance and stable deployment

## Key Technical Details
- Model Size & Memory: ~1-2GB
- Performance: ~50ms per face inference (optimized by ONNX)
- Deployment: Pre-download models during build
- Scaling: Horizontal scaling with load balancer

## Implementation Approach
```python
# Simple singleton pattern for production
class FaceRecognizer:
    _instance = None
    
    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = insightface.app.FaceAnalysis()
            cls._instance.prepare()
        return cls._instance
```

## Cost Comparison
- Self-hosted: ~$20-50/month (basic cloud VM)
- Cloud APIs: ~$1 per 1000 requests ($100 for 100k requests)
